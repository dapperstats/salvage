This page is minimal, but highlights the continuous integration (the data pulled from the FTP are used to update the **bolded** date below).

Come back for updates soon!



The most recent salvage samples posted to the FTP from the State Water Project and Central Valley Project were collected on **2020-01-23**. 

`.csv`s of the Salvage database files are available in the [salvage GitHub repository](https://github.com/dapperstats/salvage/tree/master/data/Salvage_data_FTP).
