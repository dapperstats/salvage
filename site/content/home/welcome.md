Welcome to the website for analyses of the California Delta fish salvage database, coded by [DAPPER Stats](https://www.dapperstats.com).

<br>

We provide an up-to-date [summary](https://salvage.fish/summary) of the salvage data based on the publicily available data using computational and statistical [methods](https://salvage.fish/methods).

<br>

Source code is available on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/dapperstats/salvage).

<br>

`.csv`s of the Salvage database files are available in the [salvage GitHub repository](https://github.com/dapperstats/salvage/tree/master/data/Salvage_data_FTP).

<br>

The site is currently **under construction**, so check back for updates!
